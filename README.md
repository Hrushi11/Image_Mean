# Mean in Images

This repository contains the code for my implementation of finding means in images. In the first part I have added the code for finding the mean in `(28 X 28)` images of MNIST 
dataset. In the second part I have added the code for finding the mean in `(128 X 128 X 3)` images of faces.

The Visualization for the first part looks something like this:

In future I plan to implement the same thing on RGB images, like faces, objects and things.
