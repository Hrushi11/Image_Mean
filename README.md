# Mean in Images

This repository contains the code for my implementation of finding means in images. In the first part I have added the code for finding the mean in (28 * 28) images of MNIST 
dataset.

The Visualization for the first part looks something like this:

Images             |  Mean

In future I plan to implement the same thing on RGB images, like faces, objects and things.
