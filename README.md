# Mean In Images

This repository contains the code for my implementation of finding means in images. In the first part I have added the code for finding the mean in `(28 X 28)` images of MNIST 
dataset. In the second part I have added the code for finding the mean in `(128 X 128 X 3)` images of faces. In the third part I have created a single function that takes the input as path of the directory that contains the images for which the mean needs to be calculated.

**The Visualization & Results look something like this:**
